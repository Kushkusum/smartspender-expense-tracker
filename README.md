## ü§ñ Cursor Usage Documentation

This project was developed using **Cursor AI**, which helped generate the HTML, CSS, and JS files based on prompts.  

### Example Prompts Used with Cursor

1. **HTML Generation**
Create a fully functional Expense Tracker HTML page with:

Add expense form (amount, category, date, description, recurring checkbox)

Filters (category, date range, search)

Monthly budget progress bar

Expense table with edit/delete

Statistics and charts

Dark mode toggle and currency selector

Link CSS and JS files


2. **CSS Generation**

Write modern, pastel CSS for Expense Tracker:

Style container, inputs, buttons, table, budget bar

Add hover effects, flex layout, dark mode

Responsive design for mobile (<768px)

Style chart boxes and recurring tag


3. **JavaScript Generation**

Write JS for Expense Tracker with:

Add/Edit/Delete expenses

Filters, search, currency conversion

Budget progress bar with alerts

Recurring expenses auto-add

Charts using Chart.js (doughnut & line)

Dark mode toggle and chart refresh

CSV export

LocalStorage persistence


### How Cursor Helped

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Generated fully structured, modular HTML, CSS, and JS quickly.  
- **Cross-file Consistency:** Automatically linked files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `index.js`) without errors.  
- **Complex Features:** Implemented recurring expenses, filters, and dynamic charts logic which would take hours to code manually.  
- **Theme Handling:** Integrated dark mode across all elements and charts seamlessly.  

### Modifications Made to AI-Generated Code

1. **Validation Logic:** Added checks to prevent future dates and negative amounts.  
2. **Recurring Expenses Handling:** Replaced alert pop-ups with a recurring checkbox for smoother UX.  
3. **Chart Refresh on Theme Toggle:** Ensured charts adapt to dark/light mode.  
4. **UI Polish:** Adjusted pastel colors, padding, and responsiveness for better readability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

1. **Single File Output from Cursor:**  
- Challenge: Initially, Cursor generated all 3 files (HTML, CSS, JS) inline in one file.  
- Solution: Separated the code into **3 interconnected files** with proper `<link>` and `<script>` tags.  

2. **Dark Mode & Chart Colors:**  
- Challenge: Dark mode changed UI colors but charts remained in light theme.  
- Solution: Re-rendered charts after theme toggle with appropriate pastel colors and text/grid colors.  

3. **Budget Alerts:**  
- Challenge: Triggering alerts dynamically without annoying the user.  
- Solution: Limited alert to trigger only when the monthly budget is exceeded and used a **color-coded progress bar**.  

4. **Recurring Expense Alerts:**  
- Challenge: The recurring expense logic initially displayed a pop-up alert every time the page loaded for recurring items.  
- Solution: Replaced the alert with a **recurring checkbox** in the add expense form.
